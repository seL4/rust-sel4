# Rust support for seL4 userspace

This repository contains crates for supporting the use of Rust in
[seL4](https://github.com/seL4/seL4) userspace. So far, this includes:

- Rust bindings for the seL4 API ([source](./crates/sel4))
- A runtime for root tasks ([source](./crates/sel4-root-task))
- A runtime for [seL4 Microkit](https://github.com/seL4/microkit) protection domains
  ([source](./crates/sel4-microkit))
- A [CapDL](https://docs.sel4.systems/projects/capdl/)-based system initializer ([source and
  docs](./crates/sel4-capdl-initializer))
- A loader for the seL4 kernel ([source and docs](./crates/sel4-kernel-loader))
- Custom `rustc` target specifications for seL4 userspace ([JSON and docs](./support/targets))
- Many more crates for use in seL4 userspace

The [./hacking](./hacking) directory contains scripts for developing and testing these crates using
Nix and, optionally, Docker.

This work is funded by the [seL4 Foundation](https://sel4.systems/Foundation/home.pml).

### Compatible versions of related seL4 Foundation projects

This project builds upon [seL4](https://github.com/seL4/seL4) and the [seL4
Microkit](https://github.com/seL4/microkit). In particular, this project works with at least the
following versions of those related projects:

- seL4, when used without Microkit:
  [`0260fba168b74dd2504c9447f2fa8da1161ead87`](https://github.com/seL4/seL4/tree/0260fba168b74dd2504c9447f2fa8da1161ead87)
  (on [github.com/seL4/seL4:master](https://github.com/seL4/seL4/tree/master))
- seL4, when used with Microkit:
  [`57975d485397ce1744f7163644dd530560d0b7ec`](https://github.com/seL4/seL4/tree/57975d485397ce1744f7163644dd530560d0b7ec)
  (on [github.com/seL4/seL4:microkit](https://github.com/seL4/seL4/tree/microkit))
- seL4 Microkit:
  [`f0939852c62c629346cd3eddbe7d8922eca8530a`](https://github.com/seL4/microkit/tree/f0939852c62c629346cd3eddbe7d8922eca8530a)
  (on [github.com/seL4/microkit:main](https://github.com/seL4/microkit/tree/main))

### Overview of crates

##### General crates

- [`sel4`](./crates/sel4): Straightforward, pure-Rust bindings to the seL4 API.
- [`sel4-sys`](./crates/sel4/sys): Raw bindings to the seL4 API, generated from the libsel4 headers
  and interface definition files. This crate is not intended to be used directly by application
  code, but rather serves as a basis for the `sel4` crate's implementation.
- [`sel4-config`](./crates/sel4/config): Macros and constants corresponding to the seL4 kernel
  configuration. Can be used by all targets (i.e. in all of: application code, build scripts, and
  build-time tools).
- [`sel4-platform-info`](./crates/sel4-platform-info): Constants corresponding to the contents of
  `platform_info.h`. Can be used by all targets, on configurations where this file exists..
- [`sel4-sync`](./crates/sel4-sync): Synchronization constructs using seL4 IPC. Currently only
  supports notification-based mutexes.
- [`sel4-logging`](./crates/sel4-logging): [`Log`](https://docs.rs/log/latest/log/trait.Log.html)
  implementation for the [`log`](https://crates.io/crates/log) crate.
- [`sel4-externally-shared`](./crates/sel4-externally-shared): Abstractions for interacting with
  data in shared memory.
- [`sel4-shared-ring-buffer`](./crates/sel4-shared-ring-buffer): Implementation of shared data
  structures used in the [seL4 Device Driver Framework](https://github.com/au-ts/sddf).
- [`sel4-async-*`](./crates/sel4-async): Crates for leveraging async Rust in seL4 userspace.

##### Runtime crates

- **Root task**:
  - [`sel4-root-task`](./crates/sel4-root-task): A runtime for root tasks that supports thread-local
    storage and unwinding, and provides a global allocator.
- **seL4 Microkit**:
  - [`sel4-microkit`](./crates/sel4-microkit): A runtime for [seL4
    Microkit](https://github.com/seL4/microkit) protection domains, including an implementation of
    libmicrokit and abstractions for IPC.

##### Complete programs

- [`sel4-capdl-initializer`](./crates/sel4-capdl-initializer): A
  [CapDL](https://docs.sel4.systems/projects/capdl/)-based system initializer.
- [`sel4-kernel-loader`](./crates/sel4-kernel-loader): A loader for the seL4 kernel, similar in
  purpose to [elfloader](https://github.com/seL4/seL4_tools/tree/master/elfloader-tool).

### Integrating these crates into your project

The best way to learn how to integrate these crates into your project is to check out the concrete
examples of their use [listed above](#demos).

These crates are not yet hosted on [crates.io](https://crates.io). Use them either as Git or path
Cargo dependencies.

Some of these crates depend, at build time, on external components and configuration. In all cases,
information for locating these dependencies is passed to the dependant crates via environment
variables which are interpreted by `build.rs` scripts. Here is a list of environment variables and
the crates which use them:

- `sel4-config` and `sel4-sys`, whose dependants include `sel4`, `sel4-root-task`, `sel4-microkit`,
  and many more, use `$SEL4_INCLUDE_DIRS` (defaulting to `$SEL4_PREFIX/libsel4/include` if
  `$SEL4_PREFIX` is set) which must contain a colon-separated list of include paths for the libsel4
  headers. See the the `sel4` crate's rustdoc for more information.
- `sel4-platform-info`, whose dependants include `sel4-kernel-loader`, uses `$SEL4_PLATFORM_INFO`
  (defaulting to `$SEL4_PREFIX/support/platform_gen.yaml` if `$SEL4_PREFIX` is set) which must
  contain the path of the `platform_gen.yaml` file from the seL4 kernel build system.
- `sel4-kernel-loader` uses `$SEL4_KERNEL` (defaulting to `$SEL4_PREFIX/bin/kernel.elf` if
  `$SEL4_PREFIX` is set) which must contain the path of the seL4 kernel (as an ELF executable).

### Quick start for running the tests in this repository

The only requirements for building and running the tests in this repository are Linux, Make,
[rustup](https://rustup.rs/), and [Nix](https://nix.dev/). This repository contains scripts for
setting up a Docker container with a suitable development environment in case you aren't on Linux or
don't want to install Nix.

First, clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/seL4/rust-sel4
cd rust-sel4
```

If you are using Docker, build, run, and enter a Docker container for development. This container
mounts this repository's top-level at `/work`.

```
cd hacking/docker && make run && make exec
```

At this repository's top-level directory, build and simulate a simple seL4-based system with a [root
task](./crates/examples/root-task/example-root-task) written in Rust (this will take a few minutes):

```
make example # use 'ctrl-a x' to exit the simulation
```

Build and run all of this repository's automated tests:

```
make run-tests
```
