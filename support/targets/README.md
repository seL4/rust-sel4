# Custom `rustc` target specifications for seL4 userspace

These JSON files are generated by
[`sel4-generate-target-specs`](../../crates/sel4-generate-target-specs). You can copy them directly
into your project, but if your project uses a different Rust toolchain than this project, generating
them yourself using that utility will ensure that the resulting target specs are compatible with
your Rust toolchain.

The difference between the `*-minimal` targets and the non-minimal ones are that the minimal ones
have `"has-thread-local": false`.

The difference between the `*-unwind` targets and the non-unwind ones are that the unwind ones have
`"panic = "unwind"`.

The difference between the `*-sel4-microkit` targets and the `*-sel4` ones is that the
`*-sel4-microkit` targets include a linker script fragment to add the `__sel4_ipc_buffer_obj` symbol
required by the `microkit` tool.

Note that options whose values do not deviate from the default are absent in these JSON files.
